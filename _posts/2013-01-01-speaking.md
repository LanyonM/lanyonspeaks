# Speaking Events:
I would be pleased to make a presentation to your group about my book or other relevant urban water topic such as, Lake Michigan, Calumet and Chicago Rivers, or Asian carp. My standard presentation is geared for 50 minutes, but I can be tailored to meet your needs. The listed events below are about the book, unless otherwise noted.

The book has been recognized as the single best new book published in the field of public works history by the Chicago Metro Chapter of the American Public Works Association. I accepted this award on Thursday, April 4, 2013, at a luncheon at the Medinah Shrine Center, 550 Shriners Drive, Addison, IL 60101. I will be speaking about the book at the APWA International Congress and Exposition in Chicago on August 26, 2013.
