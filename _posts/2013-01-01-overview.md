To accomplish the reversing of the flow of a river wouldn't be possible today. But to Chicago, near the end of the 19th Century, it became a matter of survival. Though it is an unlikely place for a large city, with flat topography and poor drainage, being on the shore of the Great Lakes and near to a river into the continent, Chicago was destined to be.

___Building the Canal to Save Chicago___ written by Richard Lanyon tells the story of the complexity of implementing a massive and innovative public works engineering system to save Chicago from a perilous nuisance and public health crisis.
